# Encryption-Escapade
    You're a washington D.C. detective hired by a law firm, working a case against a group of hackers, who are actively trying to aquire sensitive criminal data for their own purposes. You've been on their tails for weeks, but after a long night at the office, you're left disappointed, as the trail on the leader of the group "oracle" has gone cold. You leave your office to head home. You walk a couple blocks down the street, and you see a man with a red hoodie running across from you. You notice the insignia on the back of the hoodie. It's the insignia of the group oracle leads! It may even be oracle himself. 
    It seems too obvious, too much like a trap. But it doesn't matter, you've gotta put a stop to him. You give chase, and he leads you to some old house. Its now or never you suppose. The hacker slams the door of the house, and you slam through it a few seconds after. You walk inside, but you lost track of the hacker. Theres a laptop in front of you. 
    He's right. You were given a crash course on encryption by the tech department at the precinct, you understood about 10% of it. Tech has never been your strong suit. Gotta start somewhere though.

    The idea from here will be that as the detective, you'll have to figure out and implement different types of encryptions in order to get the information you need. Your goal is to aquire caches of criminal data that that Oracle has left behind. Oracle has left behind a series of clues on both the laptop and in physical objects around the room to help you understand how the encryption devices he wants you to use work. A rudimentary inventory system will be implemented, which will allow the players to utilize things like keys found in pots or pieces of paper that reveal code words or methods of encryption. The laptop is the central node of the project. All options and progress loop back around to getting more information on the laptop. As the player figures out how different encryption methods work, and utilizes them to solve the blocks to the information, then they get closer to the goal.
