# Encryption-Escapade
    You're a washington D.C. detective hired by a law firm, working a case against a group of hackers, who are actively trying to aquire sensitive criminal data for their own purposes. You've been on their tails for weeks, but after a long night at the office, you're left disappointed, as the trail on the leader of the group "oracle" has gone cold. You leave your office to head home. You walk a couple blocks down the street, and you see a man with a red hoodie running across from you. You notice the insignia on the back of the hoodie. It's the insignia of the group oracle leads! It may even be oracle himself. 
    It seems too obvious, too much like a trap. But it doesn't matter, you've gotta put a stop to him. You give chase, and he leads you to some old house. Its now or never you suppose. The hacker slams the door of the house, and you slam through it a few seconds after. You walk inside, but you lost track of the hacker. Theres a laptop in front of you. 
    You walk towards it, but then, you hear a slam behind you. A gigantic metal block has fallen in front of the front door, and its blocking the windows. Its of course a trap. You hear a warbled voice come in over the speakers near the laptop. "We knew you were coming. We almost have everything we need. But I'm giving you a chance detective. If you can find what I've left behind for you and get out of the house, I'll give up all the data we've aquired. But I sincerely doubt you'll make it. You don't seem like a big fan of encryption.
